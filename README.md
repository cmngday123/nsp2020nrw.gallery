Very basic instructions:

Clone repo
`git clone https://github.com/cmngday123/nsp2020nrw.gallery.git`

Make repo your working directory
`cd nsp2020nrw.gallery`

Install packages (in order to run `npm` you will need to install Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/))
`npm i`

Run local dev server
`npm run start`

Wait for the code to compile...

In a browser go to `http://localhost:3000`, and the app should be running
