        The University of Melbourne’s New Student Precinct Project welcomes you
        to the National Reconciliation Week Virtual Gallery.
      </p>
      <p>
        This annual gallery, usually presented as a physical exhibition on the
        University’s Parkville campus, is being shared online for the first
        time. It serves as a platform of active support by the University of
        Melbourne community, both Indigenous and non-Indigenous, to showcase
        artworks that express reflections in the spirit of reconciliation to
        honour the oldest living culture on Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
        This year's gallery has been curated and designed by Bachelor of 
        Environments student Cristina Napoleone and features the works of staff, 
        students and alumni who submitted images and artworks in response to this 
        year’s National Reconciliation Week theme <i>in this together</i>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        To be <i>in this together</i> is to not shy away from our grief, nor 
        our remorse. Art can help us grow through grief and amplify compassion 
        that compels us to love more and recognise a deeper kinship, toward one 
        another and our shared more-than-human world.
      </p>
      <p>
        This year marks the twentieth anniversary of the reconciliation walks of 
        2000, when people from all backgrounds came together to walk across the 
        nation and show their support for a more reconciled Australia. While many 
        steps have been taken, many steps remain as we learn our shared story.

        GALLERY MUSIC
        <i>Biik Ngarrga</i> and <i>Buln Buln Ngarrga</i>  were written and performed 
        by Mandy Nicholson live with the Djirri Djirri Dancers at The University of 
        Melbourne in April 2019. <i>Biik Ngarrga</i> is a Wurundjeri song used to 
        teach wider communities about the six interconnected layers of Country: 
        Biik-ut (Below Country), Biik-dui (On Country), Baanj Biik (Water Country), 
        Murnmut Biik (Wind Country), Wurru wurru Biik (Sky Country) and Tharangalk 
        Biik (Star Country). <i>Buln Buln Ngarrga</i> is also a Wurundjeri song that 
        honours the lyrebird, known for their expert mimicry of surrounding sounds, 
        both human and non-human.
