The outlines represent the vulnerability of our hidden personalities and the gradient colours share the inner power that fills everybody’s souls, breaking down the barriers of complexity to that of a simpler merging."

    "description": "This image was taken during COVID-19 lockdown. The artist had been walking in their local area more than ever before. They came across signage indicating the life story of the river that had become their refuge, walking guide, entertainment and home during lockdown. That evening, Birrarung appeared – more than ever – to be a waterway of mist and shadow. It's long history in time juxtaposed against the young Melbourne city skyline. The artist expresses great comfort in knowing the country, the rivers and the people in their local area have been and will continue to be in this together."

    "description": "From a series made to commemorate National Reconciliation Week 2020. Recycled materials from an aquatint made in 2010 when the artist began immigration to Australia. Inspired by the Dreamtime and the visual musical language of circles and dot art as an Indigenous Australian expression of spirit, country, water and the land. Layering communicates the many steps that have been taken by the community together so far. The artist conveys intricate interweaving colours overlapping and revealing through one another, like the sky at night that also became the morning sky when seen from an inverted angle as the piece may be viewed and displayed from all sides."
